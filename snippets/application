**An ApplicationListener**
This approach can be used for running logic after the Spring context has been initialized,
so we are not focusing on any particular bean, but waiting for all of them to initialize.
The same results can be achieved by using the newly-introduced @EventListener annotation:

    @EventListener
    public void onApplicationEvent(ContextRefreshedEvent event) {
        doSomething();
    }// end of method
