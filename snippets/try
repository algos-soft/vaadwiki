Serve per far 'risalire' l'errore. Ha senso se in alto l'errore viene gestito.
throws is a keyword in Java which is used in the signature of method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions.
The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block.

    throws keyword is required only for checked exception and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exception is meaningless.
    throws keyword is required only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword does not prevent abnormal termination of program.
    By the help of throws keyword we can provide information to the caller of the method about the exception.
