Java 9 adds some optional attributes to the @Deprecated annotation: since and forRemoval.

The since attribute requires a string that lets us define in which version the element was deprecated. The default value is an empty string.

And forRemoval is a boolean that allows us to specify if the element will be removed in the next release. Its default value is false:

	public class Worker {
	    /**
	     * Calculate period between versions
	     * @deprecated
	     * This method is no longer acceptable to compute time between versions.
	     * <p> Use {@link Utils#calculatePeriod(Machine)} instead.
	     *
	     * @param machine instance
	     * @return computed time
	     */
	    @Deprecated(since = "4.5", forRemoval = true)
	    public int calculate(Machine machine) {
	        return machine.exportVersions().size() * 10;
	    }
	}
