Default interfaces are nothing more than interfaces whose method bodies have a default implementation. This eliminates the need for abstract parent classes which define default behaviour for the interface, allowing all child classes to defer to super. Now abstract parent classes will exist if and only if there is a good reason for them, keeping code neat, organized and easy to read.
